### Data Preparation

1) In Matlab, navigate to the folder with the Neuralynx recordings. use the following function to organize your data into folders for each recording:
```
NB_prepAnalysis(your#ofrecordings)
```
2) Converting the Neuralynx .ncs recordings to a .dat file that can be read in Matlab
